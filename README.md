# focus
A productivity tool that picks up where your willpower left off

Focus helps you keep your mind on the stuff that counts by blocking distracting websites for a set amount of time. Give yourself the zen-like focus you need to finish your project, paper, homework, email ...

## Dev usage

Start the server used for blocking by typing `sudo ./run.py` while in the `blocker/` directory. Super user privileges are needed for the python flask server to edit `/etc/hosts`.

While in the `client` directoy, type `npm install && npm run watch` and in a separate terminal window type `npm start` to start the frontend react electron application.

## Download
